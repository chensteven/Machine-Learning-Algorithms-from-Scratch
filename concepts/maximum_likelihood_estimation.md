Maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) is a method used to estimate the parameters of a statistical model based on the observed data. The goal of MLE is to find the values of the model parameters that maximize the likelihood function, which measures the probability of observing the data given the values of the parameters.

To find the maximum likelihood estimate of the parameters, one typically takes the partial derivatives of the likelihood function with respect to the parameters, sets them equal to zero, and solves for the parameter values that satisfy these equations. This often involves numerical optimization methods, such as gradient descent or Newton's method, to find the parameter values that maximize the likelihood function.

The formula for maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) depends on the specific statistical model being used. In general, the goal of MLE is to estimate the values of the parameters of a statistical model that maximize the likelihood function, which measures the probability of the observed data given the parameter values.

The likelihood function, denoted by L(θ), is a function of the parameters θ of the statistical model and is defined as the joint probability density function or probability mass function of the observed data given the parameter values. That is, if we have a dataset of n independent and identically distributed data points {x1, x2, ..., xn} and a statistical model with parameters θ, then the likelihood function can be written as:

L(θ) = p(x1, x2, ..., xn | θ)

The maximum likelihood estimate of the parameter values θ, denoted by θ_MLE, is the set of values that maximizes the likelihood function. That is,

θ_MLE = argmax θ L(θ)

In practice, it is often easier to work with the logarithm of the likelihood function, called the log-likelihood function. The log-likelihood function, denoted by ℓ(θ), is defined as:

ℓ(θ) = log L(θ)

Maximizing the likelihood function is equivalent to maximizing the log-likelihood function, since the logarithm is a monotonically increasing function. Therefore, we can write the MLE formula in terms of the log-likelihood function as:

θ_MLE = argmax θ ℓ(θ)

In summary, the formula for MLE involves finding the values of the model parameters that maximize the likelihood or log-likelihood function, depending on the context. The specific form of the likelihood function and the method for maximizing it depends on the statistical model being used.



The negative log-likelihood, on the other hand, is a cost function used in optimization problems that involve maximizing the likelihood function. Specifically, minimizing the negative log-likelihood is equivalent to maximizing the likelihood function, since the negative log-likelihood is the negation of the log-likelihood function.

The negative log-likelihood is often preferred over the likelihood function as a cost function for optimization problems, because it is a convex function of the model parameters, which makes it easier to optimize. Specifically, minimizing the negative log-likelihood is equivalent to maximizing the likelihood function.

To summarize, maximum likelihood estimation is a method used to estimate the parameters of a statistical model based on the observed data by maximizing the likelihood function, while the negative log-likelihood is a cost function used to minimize the discrepancy between the observed data and the model's predictions, given the parameter values. The negative log-likelihood is often used in optimization problems that involve maximizing the likelihood function.

The negative log-likelihood and maximum likelihood estimation are both used in statistical modeling and machine learning, often in conjunction with each other. Here are a few examples and use cases:

Logistic regression: In logistic regression, the goal is to model the probability of a binary outcome (e.g., whether a customer will buy a product or not) as a function of one or more predictor variables. The parameters of the logistic regression model are typically estimated using maximum likelihood estimation, by finding the values of the parameters that maximize the likelihood function. The likelihood function is defined as the product of the probabilities of the observed outcomes given the parameter values. The negative log-likelihood is used as the cost function in logistic regression to optimize the model parameters.

Gaussian mixture models: In Gaussian mixture models (GMM), the goal is to model a population of data points as a mixture of several Gaussian distributions. The parameters of the GMM, such as the means and variances of the Gaussians, are estimated using maximum likelihood estimation. The likelihood function is defined as the probability of the observed data points given the parameter values. The negative log-likelihood is used as the cost function to optimize the GMM parameters.

Neural networks: In neural networks, the parameters of the model, such as the weights and biases of the neurons, are typically trained using backpropagation with stochastic gradient descent. The loss function used in backpropagation is often the negative log-likelihood or a variant thereof, such as cross-entropy loss, which is a generalization of the negative log-likelihood for multi-class classification problems.

In general, maximum likelihood estimation and the negative log-likelihood are widely used in statistical modeling and machine learning to estimate the parameters of models and optimize them for the observed data. Maximum likelihood estimation is used to find the values of the parameters that maximize the likelihood function, while the negative log-likelihood is used as a cost function to optimize the parameters using gradient descent or other optimization methods.
