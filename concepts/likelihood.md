In statistics, the likelihood function is a function of the model parameters that measures the probability of observing the data given the values of the parameters. More specifically, the likelihood function is the probability density function (pdf) or probability mass function (pmf) of the data, considered as a function of the parameters of the model.

To illustrate, let's assume that we have a set of n independent and identically distributed observations y1, y2, ..., yn, and we want to estimate the parameters of a statistical model that generated these observations. The likelihood function for the model parameters θ is defined as:

L(θ | y1, y2, ..., yn) = f(y1, y2, ..., yn | θ)

where f(y1, y2, ..., yn | θ) is the joint probability density function or probability mass function of the observations given the parameter values θ. The likelihood function thus measures the probability of observing the data y1, y2, ..., yn, given the parameter values θ.

The likelihood function plays a crucial role in statistical inference, particularly in maximum likelihood estimation (MLE), which is a widely used method for estimating the parameters of a statistical model based on the observed data. The MLE estimates are obtained by maximizing the likelihood function with respect to the model parameters, i.e., by finding the values of the parameters that make the observed data most likely.

Overall, the likelihood function is a key concept in statistical modeling and inference, and is used to evaluate the fit of a model to the observed data and to estimate the unknown parameters of the model.
