Here are some additional features that could be used to improve a forecasting model:

Simple time features: Extracting day of the week, month of the year, and holiday features to use as additional input variables in the model.

Lagged variables: Including variables from previous time steps to help capture autoregressive effects. Including a lagged feature with a lag of 7 days, a lagged feature with a lag of 14 days, and a rolling mean with a window of 7 days.

Moving averages: Including moving averages of the time series or other variables to help smooth out noise and capture trends.

Categorical variables: Including categorical variables that impact the time series, such as marketing promotions or holidays, to improve the accuracy of the forecast.

Interactions: Including interaction terms between variables to help capture nonlinear effects.

Time-based features: Including time-based features such as day of the week, month, or year to help capture trends and seasonality.

Trend variables: Including variables that capture trends, such as linear or quadratic trend variables, to improve the accuracy of the forecast.

Seasonal indicators: Adding seasonal indicators to the model if there is a seasonal pattern in the data.

Economic indicators: Incorporating relevant economic indicators into the model if the business is impacted by broader economic trends.

Marketing initiatives: Including variables in the model that forecast the impact of specific marketing initiatives on sales.

External factors: Incorporating external factors that could impact the business, such as weather patterns or public health trends, as variables in the model.

Social media metrics: If the business has a social media presence, including metrics such as likes, shares, and comments can help capture the impact of social media on sales.

Web traffic data: Including data on website traffic, such as the number of visitors or page views, can help capture the relationship between online activity and sales.

Demographic data: If the business serves a particular demographic group, including demographic data such as age, gender, or income can help capture the impact of these factors on sales.

Competitor data: Including data on competitors, such as their pricing or marketing strategies, can help capture the impact of competition on sales.

Product-specific features: If the business offers multiple products or services, including product-specific features such as product attributes or availability can help capture the impact of these factors on sales.

Customer data: Including data on customer behavior, such as purchasing history or customer satisfaction ratings, can help capture the relationship between customer behavior and sales.

Inventory data: Including data on inventory levels and stockouts can help capture the impact of supply chain factors on sales.

Event data: Including data on events, such as conferences or product launches, can help capture the impact of these factors on sales.

Economic data: Including data on broader economic trends, such as GDP or unemployment rates, can help capture the impact of the economy on sales.

Sentiment analysis: Using natural language processing techniques to analyze customer reviews or social media posts can help capture the overall sentiment towards the business or its products, which can impact sales.
