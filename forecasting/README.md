Here are some additional features that could be created to potentially improve the forecasting model:

Simple time features: We can then use these features as additional input variables in our forecasting model. We can extract the day of the week, month of the year, and holiday features.

Lag features: A lagged feature with a lag of 7 days, a lagged feature with a lag of 14 days, and a rolling mean with a window of 7 days

Seasonal indicators: If there is a seasonal pattern in the data, such as higher sales during certain times of the year, adding seasonal indicators to the model could improve its accuracy.

Economic indicators: If the business is impacted by broader economic trends, such as changes in interest rates or consumer confidence, incorporating relevant economic indicators into the model could help capture these effects.

Marketing initiatives: If the business is planning specific marketing initiatives, such as a new product launch or a targeted ad campaign, including these as variables in the model could help forecast their impact on sales.

External factors: Other external factors that could impact the business, such as weather patterns or public health trends, could also be incorporated as variables in the model.

It's important to note that not all of these features may be relevant or useful for every business, and identifying the most impactful features may require experimentation and analysis.
