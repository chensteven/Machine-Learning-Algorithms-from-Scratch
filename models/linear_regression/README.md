Linear regression is a statistical method used to establish a relationship between a dependent variable (often denoted as Y) and one or more independent variables (often denoted as X). The goal of linear regression is to find the best-fitting line (or hyperplane) that can explain the relationship between the variables.

In other words, linear regression attempts to find a linear relationship between the input variables and the output variable. It works by estimating the coefficients of the line that best fit the data points, such that the sum of the squared errors (the difference between the actual and predicted values) is minimized. Once the coefficients are estimated, the line can be used to make predictions on new data points.

Linear regression is a simple and widely used technique in statistics and machine learning, and can be used for various tasks such as predicting stock prices, sales forecasting, and estimating the impact of a new marketing campaign.

Linear regression is a statistical method used to establish the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. The general mathematical concept of linear regression can be described as follows:

Given a set of n observations (x1, y1), (x2, y2), ..., (xn, yn) where x is the independent variable and y is the dependent variable, we want to find the line of best fit that represents the relationship between x and y.

The equation for a linear regression model with one independent variable can be written as:

y = b0 + b1x + e

where:

y is the dependent variable
x is the independent variable
b0 is the y-intercept of the line
b1 is the slope of the line
e is the error term, which represents the deviation of the actual y values from the predicted y values
The goal of linear regression is to estimate the values of b0 and b1 that minimize the sum of the squared errors (SSE) between the predicted y values and the actual y values.

The formula for SSE is:

SSE = Σ(yi - ŷi)2

where:

yi is the actual value of the dependent variable for the ith observation
ŷi is the predicted value of the dependent variable for the ith observation
The least squares method is commonly used to estimate the values of b0 and b1 that minimize SSE. This method involves finding the values of b0 and b1 that minimize the sum of the squared differences between the actual y values and the predicted y values.

The formulas for estimating the values of b0 and b1 using the least squares method are:

b1 = Σ((xi - x̄)(yi - ȳ)) / Σ((xi - x̄)2)
b0 = ȳ - b1x̄

where:

x̄ is the mean of the independent variable
ȳ is the mean of the dependent variable
Once the values of b0 and b1 have been estimated, the equation for the line of best fit can be used to predict the value of the dependent variable for any given value of the independent variable.

When there are multiple variables, we use multiple linear regression. In multiple linear regression, we have multiple predictor variables or features, and we want to find the relationship between them and the response variable.

The mathematical formula for multiple linear regression is:

y = b0 + b1x1 + b2x2 + ... + bpxp + ε

where:

y is the response variable
x1, x2, ..., xp are the predictor variables
b0 is the intercept or constant term
b1, b2, ..., bp are the coefficients or slopes of the predictor variables
ε is the error term or random error
The goal of multiple linear regression is to estimate the values of the coefficients (b0, b1, b2, ..., bp) that minimize the sum of squared errors between the predicted values of y and the actual values of y. This is typically done using a method called least squares.
